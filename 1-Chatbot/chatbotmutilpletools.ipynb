Unlike traditional centralized AI models that rely on vast data centers, federated AI operates across multiple devices and locations, processing data locally to enhance privacy and reduce latency. [...] As AI continues to evolve, several ambitious \"moonshot\" ideas are emerging to address current limitations and push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. One such moonshot is post-Moore computing1, which aims to move beyond traditional von Neumann architecture as GPUs and TPUs near their physical and practical limits. [...] With AI models becoming increasingly complex and data-intensive, new computing paradigms are needed. Innovations in neuromorphic computing2, which mimics the neural structure of the human brain, are at the forefront of this transition. Also, optical computing3, which uses light instead of electrical signals to process information, offers promising avenues for enhancing computational efficiency and scalability.',\n",

       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to find out who the current Prime Minister of India is. Let me start by recalling what I know. India is a country in South Asia, and its government is a federal parliamentary democratic republic. The Prime Minister is the head of government and the head of the Council of Ministers. \\n\\nI remember that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha, which is the lower house of India's Parliament. The last time I checked, Narendra Modi was the Prime Minister. He was the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is a right-wing party. His party has been in power since 2014, so it's possible he's still in office.\\n\\nBut wait, when was the last election? The general elections in India are held every five years unless the government is dissolved earlier. The last election was in 2019, so the next one should be in 2024. That means Modi would be in office until then. Unless there was a by-election or a party change, which I don't recall hearing about. \\n\\nI should also consider if there's been any recent news about changes in leadership. Sometimes, due to political shifts or internal party conflicts, there can be a change, but I haven't heard anything about Modi stepping down. In fact, he's known for running strong campaigns and has a significant influence over his party.\\n\\nAnother way to verify is to think about recent events. For example, India's handling of the pandemic, economic policies, or international relations. If Modi is still in charge, those policies would be under his administration. Also, looking at his tenure, he's been in office since 2014, so it's likely he's serving his second term now, which would end in 2024.\\n\\nWait, but I should check if there's any recent information. Maybe there was a recent state election that shifted power, but even if that happened, it wouldn't necessarily affect the national Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is elected nationally, so unless the BJP loses the general election, Modi would remain.\\n\\nAlso, considering the current year is 2023. Since the next election is in 2024, he's still in office. Therefore, the current Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe current Prime Minister of India is **Narendra Modi**. He has been serving in this role since May 26, 2014, and is currently in his second term following the 2019 general elections. A member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Modi is known for his leadership in various policy initiatives and has a significant influence in Indian politics. The next general elections are scheduled for 2024. \\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- **Name:** Narendra Modi  \\n- **Party:** Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  \\n- **Term:** Since 2014 (re-elected in 2019)  \\n- **Next Election:** 2024  \\n\\nFor the most up-to-date information, always verify with recent news or official government sources.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 658, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 671, 'completion_time': 1.943463932, 'prompt_time': 0.000343584, 'queue_time': 0.055336965, 'total_time': 1.9438075160000001}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--ad86d2e0-35ec-4fec-a59b-3b6924461243-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 658, 'total_tokens': 671})"
