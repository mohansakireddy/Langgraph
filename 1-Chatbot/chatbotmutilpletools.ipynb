       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, so the user is asking who the Prime Minister of India is. Let me start by recalling the current government structure in India. India is a parliamentary democracy, so the Prime Minister is the head of government. The President is the head of state, but the Prime Minister holds the executive power.\\n\\nAs of my last update, the Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi. He has been in office since 26 May 2014, and he was re-elected in 2019. I should check if there have been any changes since then. Let me think—no, I don\\'t recall any recent elections or changes in leadership. The next general election is scheduled for 2024, so he should still be in office unless there\\'s been an unexpected development.\\n\\nWait, the user might be asking for a more detailed answer. Let me confirm. The user just asked \"who is pm of india\" so maybe they want a straightforward answer, but sometimes people might want a bit more context. Let me make sure to mention the dates and party affiliation. Narendra Modi is the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). His tenure has been marked by several initiatives like Make in India, Digital India, and the demonetization move in 2016, though that was controversial.\\n\\nI should also note that the Prime Minister is appointed by the President, but in practice, it\\'s the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha. The BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha since 2014, so Modi remains the PM. It\\'s possible that if the user is not familiar with Indian politics, they might confuse the roles of President and PM, so maybe a quick note on that would help.\\n\\nAlso, just to be thorough, let me check if there\\'s any interim Prime Minister or acting PM situation. But no, currently it\\'s Modi. So the answer is straightforward. However, I should present it clearly, maybe start with the current PM, then add the party, tenure, and perhaps some key policies. That way, the user gets a complete answer without having to ask follow-up questions.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe current Prime Minister of India is **Narendra Modi**.
